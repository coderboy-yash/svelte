Hi yash,
Welcome to Nerve Sparks. As part of your initial evaluation for the Frontend Developer Internship, we kindly request that you develop two web pages using Svelte (specifically, SvelteKit along with Svelte stores and sessionStorage is recommended) and Tailwind CSS.

Page 1:
The page structure should include the following components:
1. Collapsible Sidebar/Drawer:
• The sidebar should contain a list of dummy data (referred to as data1) presented in the form of cards.
• The sidebar should also feature a search functionality, allowing users to easily locate specific cards.
• Additionally, an option to add new cards should be provided, facilitated by a modal window.
2. Content Area:
• By default, the content area should remain empty.
• Once a card within the sidebar is clicked, the content area should dynamically populate with a list of nested dummy data (referred to as data2) specific to the selected card.
• Similar to the sidebar, the content area should include search and filter functionalities, enabling users to efficiently explore and navigate the nested data.
• Furthermore, users should be able to add new cards to the content area via a modal window.
• At the top of the content area, an expand button should be available to reveal the contents of the currently selected card (data2) on the second page.

For example, the sidebar could contain names and descriptions of various car companies, while the content area would display all the car models sold by the selected company.

Page 2:
The structure of this page should consist of the following component:
1. Content Area:
• This area should display dummy data in the form of cards, similar to the content area on page 1.
• Users should have the ability to search and filter the displayed data, ensuring an efficient browsing experience.
• Additionally, a modal window should allow users to add new cards to the content area.

It is important to note that data persistence is a requirement both across pages and within sessions.

NOTE
It is not expected from you to implement all the functionalities mentioned above, your willingness and ability to learn is a more significant factor in evaluating your performance. However, a complete and comprehensive project will be highly regarded during the assessment process.
